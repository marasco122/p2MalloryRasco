                <li>The tachometer and speedometer are the same size.</li>
                <li>The engine temperature display has the temp in Celsius specifically.</li>
                <li>The gas gauge labels are not obvious, with full being displayed as 1/1, <br> which doesn't mean anything.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design Pros</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There is an outside temperature display.</li>
                <li>The miles per hour and kilometers per hour numbers are different colors <br> on the speedometer, differentiating them.</li>

            <br>
            <h3>Case 2</h3>

                <li>The gas gauge is high and doesn't get hidden behind the steering wheel.</li>
                <li>The miles per hour and kilometers per hour numbers are different colors <br> on the speedometer, differentiating them.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Case 4</h3>

                <li>There is an outside temperature display.</li>

                <li>There's no outside temperature display.</li>
                <li>The kilometers per hour numbers are a bit small, and easily missed.</li>
                <li>The tachometer and speedometer run into each other, and have the <br> same font and color scheme. At first glance, it's hard to differentiate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design Pros</h3>

                <li>The gear shift is displayed.</li>

            <h2>Common Uses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Check at what speed the car is currently driving.</li>
                <li>Watch the gas level, and re-fill it when it gets low.</li>
                <li>Check the outside temperature, if display is present.</li>
                <li>See warnings, when they pop up.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Rare Uses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Seeing the current gear shift position.</li>
                <li>Although it is crucial, it is very rare to have to check the temperature <br> of the engine. It is usually okay.</li>
                <li>Same with the tachometer. It is important, but it usually never reaches <br> the red zone.</li>
                <li>Console applications are not displayed on the dashboard, like a map <br> or controlling music.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>User Interactions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When the gas or brake pedals are used, the speedometer reflects the <br> change in speed.</li>
                <li>Specifically when the gas pedal is pushed, the tachometer increases <br> when the speed does.</li>
                <li>When using the turn signals, the arrow display turns on until the turn <br> is complete. And the emergency signal keeps both 
                    arrows flashing until <br> it is manually turned off.</li>
                <li>When using the cruise control, the display turns on and says when it is set.</li>
                <li>When the gas is re-filled, the gauge resets to show the current level.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking at the tachometer, instead of the speedometer.</li>
                <li>Using the kilometers per hour numbers, instead of the miles per hour.</li>
                <li>Thinking the gas cap is on the wrong side of the car.</li>
                <li>Not understanding the warning symbol.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Design Improvements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The speedometer should be large and prominent.</li>
                <li>The specific numerical speed should be displayed, and easily read.</li>
                <li>There should be a way to switch between miles per hour and kilometers per hour.</li>
                <li>A label can be added to the warning symbols, to specify what they mean.</li>
            </ul>
