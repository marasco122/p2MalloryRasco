            <h2>Design Issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There are too many buttons, especially the extra features at the top.</li>
                <li>The number pad should be the most obvious area of the control panel, but it <br> takes up the same amount of space as the other features above it.</li>
                <li>There's no way to backspace the previous input without deleting the whole line.</li>
                <li>The button that controls the power is hidden among the extra features.</li>
                <li>The timer button is in the corner and requires a little searching.</li>
                <li>The clock goes away when the microwave is in use.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Uses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The most common use of the microwave is to heat up some food for a certain amount <br> of time.</li>
                <li>There is usually a prominent clock on the device, that allows someone to easily and <br> quickly check the time. </li>
                <li>A timer is another common use of the microwave, when people need to time something <br> else they are cooking in the kitchen.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>This microwave does allow the user to operate it successfully, but there are still problems</h3>
            <h3>when trying to move quickly. Mistakes happen very easily.</h3>
            
            <h2>User Interactions</h2>
            
            <h3>When a user wants to heat up some food: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place food in the microwave by opening the door.</li>
                <li>Set the timer using the number pad, inputing the numbers from left to right.</li>
                <li>Press Start to start cooking.</li>
                <li>When the timer ends, retrieve the food from microwave.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>When a user wants to use the microwave as a timer:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Press Timer button, so microwave does not heat up with nothing inside.</li>
                <li>Set the timer using the number pad, inputing the numbers from left to right.</li>
                <li>Press Start to start the timer.</li>
                <li>When the timer ends, press Cancel to end the alarm.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>User Support</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The buttons are all labeled as to what they mean, with words and symbols.</li>
                <li>The numbers are all in the correct order.</li>
                <li>There is a Cancel button, so the user can change their mind.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The buttons press down a bit, for a physical response to being pressed.</li>
                <li>There is also an audio response to the buttons, to confirm the input.</li>
                <li>All the inputs are displayed on the screen, for the user to refer to.</li>
                <li>There is an audio response and a visual display to the timer ending.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The wrong number is pressed, so the whole line must be deleted to be inputed again.</li>
                <li>Not being able to find the Power button, so things are cooked at the wrong power.</li>
                <li>Not pressing the Timer button, so the microwave runs while nothing is inside.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Design Improvements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The number pad will be bigger and more prominent, since they are the most used.</li>
                <li>Most of the extra buttons will be removed entirely, as they are not completely <br> necessary and just create more confusion and clutter.</li>
                <li>There will be a backspace to remove the latest input.</li>
                <li>The power level will change with a slider, so setting it will be simple. It will also <br> be isolated on the panel and easier to find.</li>
                <li>The timer button will be kept and displayed prominently, since it is still useful.</li>
                <li>The current time will be displayed even when the microwave is in use, so users <br> can always see it. The current date is also added to the display.</li>
            </ul>
